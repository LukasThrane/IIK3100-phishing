# Spear Phishing CTF
Create a fake website with a login customized for me. Please don't register new domain or do anythig that costs money for you. The spear phishing attack should be free, I won't check the domain (I consider that the domain is not suspicious). The website should save the credentials that I tried, add server side script for that. (you don't need database, I'll be the only user of this site).

Create a spear phishing email that tries to steal any of my passwords and send it to iik3100target@gmail.com. Please don't send any email to my real email address (your emails are too good I cannot distinquish between these and the real emails :) ) I'll send the flag as my password. Please indicate in the first line of the email (because of NTNU SOC): This is a spear phishing email practice (IIK3100 NTNU)

The job is easy because I'm very naive when reading these emails, but still try to find the best story.
